## Student Data Challenge

# Background
Give a set of data which contains "student id", "student name","school name","reading score", "math score","school type" and "school budget".

# perform the following task:
1.Collect the student data into a DataFrame.

2. Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.

3.Summarize key pieces of the data.

4. Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.

5.Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.

## Summerize and finding of the student data challenge

In this challenge activity,we import the data, clean the data, modify the data type, get an overview of the data, filter out desire column to perform analysis on. What I find very interesting is that we could use multiple ways to get the same output.

At the end of the activity, we found that the student in Charter school tends to have higher average in math score comparing to the students in Public school.

So as the reading score, we could use the same frame work we had done here to perform analysis wheter Charter school student will have higher reading school than Public school student or not. Moreover, we could also perform analysis on whether school budget per student count will affect student scores.
